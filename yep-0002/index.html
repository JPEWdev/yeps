<p>This document outlines a proposal to backport the SPDX 3 Software Bill of
Material (SBoM) support currently on master of OpenEmbedded Core to the Yocto
5.0 (scarthgap) release branch. This is a change from the normal stable release
branch policy of not backporting major features to stable branches.</p>
</section>
<section id="background">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#background" role="doc-backlink">Background</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/">SPDX 3.0</a> was released on April 14th, 2024. While Yocto was a very early
adopter and had an implementation of SPDX 3 in development even before the
final release, this timeline was still to tight to fit in for the Yocto 5.0
release window, since it also released in April. As a result, Yocto 5.1
(Styhead) was to first release to have SPDX 3 support.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, this means that there is currently no Yocto Long Term
Support (LTS) release that supports SPDX 3, since Yocto 5.0 is the most recent
LTS release and will be supported until April 2028. The next scheduled LTS
release is Yocto 6.0 (Wrynose), scheduled for April 2026.</p>
<p>Yocto has supported creating <a class="reference external" href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.2.2/">SPDX 2.2</a> SBoMs since the 3.4 release (Honister,
October 2021). However, while these SBoMs do provide useful and actionable
information, it was discovered in the course of implementation that this
version of SPDX was incapable of precisely describing some of the more
complicated nuances that occur in Yocto builds, and also was insufficient to
describe the process by which software vulnerabilities were patched in upstream
layers.  As such, the implementation spurred members of the Yocto community to
be more involved in the design of the then upcoming SPDX 3 release. This
interaction was mutually beneficial for both projects; Yocto was able to ensure
that SPDX 3 could express the more complicated situations that arise during
builds, and SPDX got advice on concrete examples of the complicated builds, as
well as having a very early adopter of the new standard. Yocto SBoMs are often
provided as examples of what a SPDX 3.0 document can/should look like.</p>
<p>As of the date of this document, the master branch of OpenEmbedded Core still
supports both SPDX 2.2 and SPDX 3.0. However, SPDX 3.0 is considered the better
implementation, and is the one enabled by default when building. SPDX 2.2
support does still receive bug fixes, but most of the SPDX development effort
focus on SPDX 3.0.</p>
<p>On 23 October, 2024 the European Union (EU) ratified
<a class="reference external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj">Regulation (EU) 2024/2847</a> (commonly referred to as the Cyber Resilience Act
or CRA) with the general goal of improving the cybersecurity posture of
consumer software in the EU. The regulation imposes many requirement on
software suppliers, and goes into full effect in 11 December, 2027 (with some
parts not relevant to this document going into effect sooner in mid 2026).</p>
<p>One of the requirements of the CRA is that manufacturers be able to provide the
EU with an SBoM for any software covered under the regulation. The purpose of
this SBoM is to provide information about the software and its dependencies, as
well as evaluate the software for exposure to vulnerabilities (e.g. check if
any CVEs affect it).</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that as of the time of this writing, the CRA
does not have concrete requirements for supplier SBoMs. These are still in the
process of being written by the EU, with the expectation that they will be
complete some time in 2026.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem-statement">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#problem-statement" role="doc-backlink">Problem Statement</a></h2>
<p>The Yocto project is in good position to provide <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0N4FnkwTOY">comprehensive SBoMs</a> to its
users through the SPDX support implemented in OpenEmbedded Core. These
generated SBoM can go a long way toward helping end users comply with the CRA
SBoM requirements.</p>
<p>With the Yocto 5.0 release set to leave support in April 2028, there is a
roughly 5 month overlap between the enforcement of the CRA and the end of
support for Yocto 5.0. Given the typical timing of software life cycles, it is
highly likely that many users will be needing software built with Yocto 5.0 to
comply with the CRA SBoM requirements.</p>
<p>However, the SPDX 2.2 support that is currently available in Yocto 5.0 is
lacking in a few key points related to CRA compliance, specifically in regard
to vulnerability reporting. It is also worth noting that as more concrete
information about the CRA comes out in the next years, the SPDX community will
likely be willing to make updates and changes to the SPDX 3 specification in
order make compliance easier; it is less likely that they will do the same for
the SPDX 2.2 specification.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposed-solution">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#proposed-solution" role="doc-backlink">Proposed Solution</a></h2>
<p>The proposed solution to this problem is to backport the SPDX 3.0 support
currently on master to the Yocto 5.0 stable branch, bypassing the normal policy
of not backporting major features. This would provide end users with the higher
quality SBoMs required by the CRA, and would also put the project in a better
position to implement any other changes required by the CRA, since all
supported version of Yocto would then have SPDX 3.0 support (ignoring the Yocto
4.0 “Kirkstone” release which goes out of support April 2026).</p>
<p>The bulk of the work to do this backport has already been <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/topic/115086052">proposed</a> on the
openembeded-core mailing list. A through review of this proposal is still
necessary, but the overall strategy has been reviewed and approved by the
original SPDX 3 author.</p>
<p>This proposal would see SPDX 2.2 remain the default option for generation of
SPDX data on the Yocto 5.0 branch, so as not to break backward compatibility.
User could then switch from SPDX 2.2 to SPDX 3.0 as desired.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternate-solutions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#alternate-solutions" role="doc-backlink">Alternate Solutions</a></h2>
<p>The commonly used alternative solution to backports into stable branches is to
leverage the layering power of bitbake to provide the backport in a separate
layer. This has been done many times, with several examples in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-lts-mixins/">meta-lts-mixins</a> repository. However, this approach is not recommended for
backporting SPDX 3 for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The SPDX 3 code makes several changes to parts of the codebase that cannot
be easily modified in a separate layer, including python library code and
bbclass files.</li>
<li>Backporting in this method would make it harder to backport any additional
future changes desired for CRA compliance, or bug fixes. If the change is
done directly in OpenEmbedded Core, simple backports can be done from master
to the stable branch</li>
</ol>
